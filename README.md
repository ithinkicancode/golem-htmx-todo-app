# Mission Statement

This is my experiment to resurrect MPA (multiple-page app) and Web 1.0 server-side rendering to kill SPA+JS frameworks+JSON ðŸŽ¯ all in one stone via htmx+Golem ðŸ˜ˆ The pendulum will swing back ðŸ”„ as (tech) history has shown. It's my attempt to prove that REST API, Javascript-frameworks and JSON serde are a thing of the past, and serverless server-side rendering (oxymoron? lol) is the future (or back to the future).
